System Architecture
This document describes the architectural design of the Outlook Signature Intelligence Extraction Engine. It outlines the core components, their responsibilities, and how data flows through the system.
________________________________________
High-Level Overview
Outlook Desktop
     │
     ▼
Phase 1 – Extraction
  • Outlook COM access
  • Folder & subfolder traversal
  • HTML cleaning
  • Signature boundary detection
  • JSONL cache writer
     │
     ▼
Cache Layer (JSONL files)
     │
     ▼
Phase 2 – Consolidation
  • Cache loader
  • NLP name extraction
  • Rule-based title & department detection
  • Scoring & deduplication
     │

Final Output (Excel / CSV)

Architectural Goals
•	Reproducibility – All intermediate results are stored as JSONL for deterministic reruns.
•	Separation of concerns – Extraction, cleaning, enrichment, and output stages are independent.
•	Resilience – Outlook COM access is isolated and safeguarded against common crash patterns.
•	Transparency – NLP and rule-based decisions are explainable and debuggable.
•	Extensibility – Adding new rules, dictionaries, or ML models does not require redesigning the pipeline.

Core Components
1. Outlook Client (outlook_client.py)
Provides safe access to Outlook folders using pywin32.
Responsibilities:
•	Resolve root folders
•	Validate folder indices
•	Provide MailItem iterators
•	Handle common COM error scenarios
________________________________________
2. Folder Iterators (outlook_iterators.py)
A robust mechanism for iterating emails in folders, addressing:
•	COM crashes
•	Unexpected message formats
•	Filtering by date
•	Excluding ignored senders
•	Notification email detection
________________________________________
3. HTML Cleaning (html_cleaner.py)
Transforms raw HTML into normalized plain text:
•	Removes reply histories
•	Strips disclaimers
•	Eliminates styling and scripting tags
•	Normalizes whitespace
•	Produces “core lines” used in signature extraction
________________________________________
4. Signature Extraction (signature_extractor.py)
Key logic for identifying signature boundaries and meaningful content.
Extracts:
•	Sender name candidates
•	Job title fragments
•	Department indicators
•	Company references
•	Relevant metadata
This happens using a combination of heuristics, keyword detection, and structural analysis.

5. NLP Name Extraction (nlp_extractor.py)
Uses spaCy to:
•	Detect person names
•	Validate extracted names
•	Suppress false positives through blacklist and scoring
________________________________________
6. Aggregation Layer (aggregation.py)
Responsible for:
•	Grouping results by sender
•	Ranking multiple signatures per sender
•	Selecting the single best record per email address
•	Preparing output rows
Ranking criteria include:
•	presence of name
•	completeness of position
•	presence of department
•	recency
________________________________________
7. Export Layer (exporter.py)
Outputs final consolidated data in:
•	UTF-8 Excel format
•	UTF-8-BOM CSV (for Windows compatibility)
________________________________________
Cache Layer
JSONL files store one cleaned record per email message.
Benefits:
•	Fast reprocessing
•	Easier debugging
•	Separation of extraction (Outlook-dependent) from analysis (Outlook-independent)
________________________________________
Extensibility
Additions can be made without breaking architecture:
•	More rules in /config dictionaries
•	Additional NLP models
•	Machine learning classifiers
•	CRM or API integrations
•	Web UI layers on top
