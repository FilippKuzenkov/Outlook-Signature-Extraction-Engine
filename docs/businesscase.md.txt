Business Case: Strategic Contact Intelligence Extraction
This system was developed to support the creation of the 2026 Marketing & Sales Strategy by providing a clear view of who within client organizations communicates with us and in what capacity.
________________________________________
Problem Statement
Client communication often involves individuals from multiple departments:
•	Marketing
•	Purchasing
•	Engineering
•	HR
•	Operations
•	Product Management
However, this information is locked inside inconsistent, multilingual email signatures.
Manually analyzing thousands of emails is too slow and error-prone to support strategic planning.
________________________________________
Objective
To automatically extract and consolidate:
•	Names
•	Job titles
•	Departments
•	Organizational roles
from 11,352 incoming emails distributed across multiple mailbox folders.
This allows the organization to:
•	Identify key stakeholders
•	Build communication maps
•	Understand account structures
•	Support data-driven decision-making
________________________________________
Outcome
•	250–300 unique contact profiles extracted
•	Clean, consistent dataset suitable for:
o	CRM enrichment
o	Stakeholder mapping
o	Strategy workshops
o	Cross-functional alignment
•	Reduced multi-week manual workload to minutes
•	Established repeatable annual process
________________________________________
Business Value
The system enabled the marketing and leadership teams to:
•	Identify engagement points within major accounts
•	Understand which departments contact us most
•	Map decision-maker chains
•	Improve targeted communication strategies
•	Prepare data-backed 2026 planning documentation
The result was increased clarity, efficiency, and insight for strategic planning.
